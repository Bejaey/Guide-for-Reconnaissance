# Top 10 Hacker Tools and Techniques

By understanding how hackers gain access to systems, organizations can stay a step ahead and ensure information availability, integrity, and confidentiality. Listed below is Altius IT's list of the Top 10 Hacker Tools and Techniques:

1) Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance, also known as the preparatory phase, is where the hacker gathers information about a target before launching an attack and is completed in phases prior to exploiting system vulnerabilities. One of the first phases of Reconnaissance is dumpster diving. It is during this phase that the hacker finds valuable information such as old passwords, names of important employees (such as the head of the network department), and performs an active reconnaissance to know how the organization functions. As a next step, the hacker completes a process called footprinting to collect data on the security posture, reduces the focus area such as finding out specific IP addresses, identifies vulnerabilities within the target system, and finally draws a network map to know exactly how the network infrastructure works to break into it easily. Footprinting provides important information such as the domain name, TCP and UDP services, system names, and passwords. There are also other ways to do footprinting, including impersonating a website by mirroring it, using search engines to find information about the organization, and even using the information of current employees for impersonation. 


# Top 10 Tools for Reconnaissance

1) Google

For every penetration tester, Google should be the first tool to use for continuous cyber recon. Google and other search engines like Bing are vital during reconnaissance because it provides vital data about individuals, companies, and data including leaked content. The obtained information is free and can help to determine the direction a penetration tester will take. 

2) Maltego

Maltego is a visual link analysis and data mining tool and it is the most famous software for performing Open Source Intelligence. It provides a library of plugins, called “transforms”, which are used to execute queries on open sources in order to gather information about a certain target and display them on a nice graph. In fact, differently from the command line tools seen until now, Maltego has a Graphical User Interface through which the user performs his research and analyzes results returned on the graph.

It is developed by Paterva which distributes three different versions: Maltego XL, Classic and CE. We are interested in Maltego CE which stands for Community Edition: this is the non commercial version and it is available for everyone after a quick registration.

Installation

Before proceeding with the installation it is a good idea to register at this link: https://www.paterva.com/web7/community/community.php. In fact, in order to use the software it is mandatory to have a Maltego account which is required at the startup of the application.

If you are using Kali Linux, Maltego CE is already installed. Moreover you will find that Kali has its own custom version called Maltego Chlorine, which has been made on purpose for this distro.
Otherwise you can download the package from https://www.paterva.com/web7/downloads.php#tab-3 and install it on your operating system (the software is available for Windows, Linux or Mac OSX).
